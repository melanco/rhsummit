Pr√©sentateurs : Chris wlls / Gunnar Helekson

Where are we going to take it in the future

What is the vision ? 

Mission statement :

RHEL is the source for safe and reliable linux innovation that make your workloads sucuessful

Everywhere you want it - On prem, virtual, in the cloud

Serves the redhat portfolio and the red hat ecosystem.

Where we‚Äôve been

RHEL has more than 10000 porjects.

RHEL is the foundation. The original hydrbrid cloud application platform. (everything as a service, modern apps, containers and microservices, ISVs)

The value of a red hat enterprise linux subscription. 

Support, secutiry updates, partners ecosystem.

How it started :

UNIX ‚Äî> RHEL

How it‚Äôs going :
Majority of new workloads ‚Äî> RHEL

Where we are:

Support all cloud providers and partners. 

RHEL 9.2, 8.8

Make linux simpler and more efficient

More easily manage production workloads

Broader support for innovative new hardware

Resilient containers with automated podman health checs and improved event logging make it safer to deploy containers at scale.

Key points who want to run bout oracle announcement.

Redhat and Oracle will officially support joint customers in oracle cloud.

RHEL tomorrow.

Library of trusted content.

Image builder

Host management tools.  (find if they need a patch, do it from website)

System roles

Second step ‚Äî> Disconnected environnement.

Traditionnal ‚Äî> RHEL DVD

Moving forward will be creating an image and deploying it. 

System roles protects us from major releases and updates.

Management for all (insights)

- Making it easier to manage systems anywhere.
- Simplified end-to-end system management
- Delivered as a service - no infrastructure overhead.
- Intereactive guidance to lower the learning curve
- Included with sub

Convert2Rhel is the way to migrate from centOS to rhel. 

It now works on Azure/AWS/GCP so you dont have to destroy your rhel7 .Coming q3.

Where we‚Äôre going

Step1 : Management for all

Step2 : Moving management from run-time to build-time

Most systems are run-time and they want to migrate that to build time. 

Management tool for image builds. 

RHEL wiill now come with an AI in image builder.

‚ÄúDid you know that most customers who install this Nginx package also install that packages‚Äù

Step3 : Optimizing for different infrastructure 

The hardware world is very strange and a lot for architecture are popping up. 

One kernel can not do everything. 

Specific kernel for 64bit Arm for example. 

Variations of RHEL (14 to 17 version at any time) but it can become manageable. 

Step 4 : Expanding your secure supply chain

13 000 packages 

How many in the OS (200) ! 

Customers ask for new packages so they need to keep adding üôÇ

The reason we dont do it today is we have no tool. 

Now we have the tool.

A universe of software. for apps, for infra, run and optimized on any infra.
